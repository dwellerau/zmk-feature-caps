      Builds the Caps status widget that can show:
        - Caps Lock (from HID indicators), and
        - Caps Word state (from ZMK Caps Word), if available.

      This option is presented only when:
        * ZMK_DISPLAY is enabled (LVGL present), and
        * ZMK_CAPS_WORD is enabled (for the Caps Word indicator).

      If HID indicators are not enabled in your ZMK build, the widget still
      compiles, but only the Caps Word portion will update.
